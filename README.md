# TSP
Optimization of travelling salesperson problem (TSP) using PuLP 

In this project, PuLP is used to find the shortest distance route for six cities. Row i and column j of the matrix give c[i][j]. i=1, so the first row represents the starting point. For example, the value in the first row and second column shows the distance from the first city to the second city.

"Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)- Given a set of cities and the distance between every pair of cities as an adjacency matrix, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total distance travelled, forming a closed tour or circuit. The TSP is referred to as an NP-hard problem, meaning there is no known algorithm to solve it in polynomial time for large instances. As the number of cities increases, the number of potential solutions grows exponentially, making an exhaustive search unfeasible."
